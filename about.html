                    <p class="lead">Hi, my name is Ezatollah Rahimi. I am 22 years old and I have a die hard passion for Coding.</p>
                    <p>My love for coding began, back when I was in High School, aged 15. At the end of an IT lesson, I headed over to my teacher's desk, to hand my work in, and that's when I saw my first ever bit of coding. At the time, I was not aware, what these random brackets, semi-colons and RGB values were, and what they did, but they sparked my interest.</p>
                    <p>So, out of curiosity, I asked my teacher, what he was doing and he replied: "I'm programming". He wrote a 'marquee' tag and some bits of text and then ran his code, and to my amazement, I saw scrolling text on a blank webpage. Now that I think about it, it was not the most complex bit of code, or the most attractive of things, however, it was enough to interest me to start a fantastic adventure into the world of 'Programming'.</p>
                    <p>So I ran home, feeling excited at having discovered something new. I booted up my PC and did some research on what was possible with programming and what I found was absolutely amazing. The people that program and work with code were called 'Programmers' and they were these talented computer wizards, who turned customers' imagination into reality. I thought to myself; "This is what I want to do".</p>
                    <p>Once out of High school, I studied Electronic & Electrical Engineering at College and from there I went into University and completed a Computer Engineering Degree; where I was taught, the difference between bad code and good code, coding practices, and was introduced to some amazing programming languages. Now having graduated from University, I have taken numerous online courses, to further develop my programming skills. I am now looking for a career in programming...</p>
